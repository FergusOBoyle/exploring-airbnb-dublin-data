# exploring_airbnb_dublin_data
Answering a number of questions related to Airbnb Dublin data.

The motivation behind this was a project requirement for the Udacity Data Science Nano Degree Term 2. It had been requested to pick a data set and do some exploratory analysis and then produce a blog post with 3 findings from the data. 

## Packages

The analysis is delivered in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. This can be installed using Anaconda (see below).

Required packages are specified in requirements.yml.

## Installation

1. Dowload Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
2. Install Anaconda using [these](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) instructions.
3. Create a new environment in the Anaconda Shell: >conda create -n my_new_env --file required_packages.yml.
4. Switch to the new environment: >conda activate my_new_env.
5. Launch jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Shell (>jupyter notebook) and navigate to the location of Airbnb.ipynb.

## Data

Data has not been included as part of the repo; however, it is straighforward to access from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Specifically for this project, the listings.csv.gz file pertaining to Dublin, Ireland was used.
